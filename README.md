chosen category by the user . The user may further add the items to 
the cart and once the items are added , the program provides a 
confirmatory message to confirm the adding of the respective item 
chosen by the user into the shopping cart.
 Further the program asks the user if he/she is interested in 
adding/removing items from the cart , it also provides an option to end 
the shopping if the user has added all the items to his cart already. 
With the appropriate input from the user , the program either adds 
new items from another category of items selected by the user , 
removes the already added items or exits the program .
 After each addition of item to the cart , the program displays the 
amount of each product and the total cost of the bill. The program 
continues to run until the user is done shopping for all of his/her items 
and chooses to exit the program. Further the program provides the 
choice of payment to the user and according to the user inputted 
choice , respective inputs is taken and it proceeds to the payment.
